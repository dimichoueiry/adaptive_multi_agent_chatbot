# Technical Report: Adaptive Multi-Agent Chatbot System using Ollama

## Executive Summary

This technical report details the design, implementation, and evaluation of an Adaptive Multi-Agent Chatbot System using Ollama. The system features a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents for different domains, context-awareness capabilities, and integration with external knowledge sources. The system successfully demonstrates the application of modern AI techniques to create an intelligent conversational system that can adapt to different query domains and maintain coherent multi-turn conversations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Objective

The objective of this project was to design and implement a multi-agent chatbot system that leverages Ollama for intelligent conversations across multiple domains. The system needed to adapt dynamically based on context, past interactions, and external knowledge sources.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional chatbots often struggle with:
- Limited domain knowledge
- Inability to maintain context over multiple interactions
- Lack of integration with external knowledge sources
- Poor routing of queries to appropriate knowledge domains

This project addresses these limitations through a multi-agent architecture, context tracking, and knowledge integration.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Multi-Agent Coordinator**: Central component that analyzes queries and routes them to appropriate specialized agents
2. **Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific agents for general questions, Concordia CS admissions, and AI-related topics
3. **Knowledge Enhancement**: Integration with external sources like Wikipedia
4. **Context Management**: Tracking of conversation history for context-aware responses
5. **API Layer**: FastAPI-based interface for client interactions

### 2.2 Component Interactions

The system operates through the following workflow:

1. User submits a query through the API
2. The coordinator analyzes the query content and conversation context
3. The coordinator routes the query to the most appropriate specialized agent
4. External knowledge is retrieved and integrated with the query
5. The selected agent processes the enhanced query and generates a response
6. The response is returned to the user and added to conversation history

### 2.3 Technology Stack

The implementation leverages the following technologies:

- **Ollama**: For LLM-based response generation
- **LangChain**: For memory and prompt engineering
- **FastAPI**: For API deployment
- **Vector Databases**: For contextual memory storage (placeholder implementation)
- **Wikipedia API**: For external knowledge integration
- **Python**: As the primary programming language

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Multi-Agent Architecture

The multi-agent architecture consists of:

- **BaseAgent**: Abstract base class defining the agent interface
- **GeneralAgent**: Handles general knowledge questions
- **ConcordiaCSAgent**: Specializes in Concordia University CS admissions
- **AIAgent**: Specializes in artificial intelligence topics
- **MultiAgentCoordinator**: Routes queries to appropriate agents

The coordinator uses keyword matching and conversation context to determine the most appropriate agent for each query.

### 3.2 Context-Awareness Implementation

Context-awareness is implemented through:

- **ConversationManager**: Tracks conversation history across multiple sessions
- **History Formatting**: Converts conversation history into a format suitable for agent consumption
- **Context-Based Routing**: Uses conversation history to determine query context

### 3.3 Knowledge Integration

External knowledge integration is implemented through:

- **WikipediaSource**: Retrieves information from Wikipedia
- **KnowledgeEnhancer**: Enhances queries with external knowledge
- **Vector Store**: Placeholder implementation for storing and retrieving document embeddings

### 3.4 API Implementation

The API is implemented using FastAPI with:

- **Router**: Defines API endpoints for chat and agent listing
- **Request/Response Models**: Structured data models for API interactions
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and status codes

## 4. Evaluation

### 4.1 Functionality Assessment

The system successfully implements all required functionality:

- Multi-agent architecture with specialized agents
- Context-awareness for multi-turn conversations
- Integration with external knowledge sources
- API for client interactions

### 4.2 Performance Considerations

While not fully benchmarked, the system design considers performance through:

- Limiting conversation history length
- Efficient query routing
- Asynchronous API implementation

### 4.3 Limitations

Current limitations include:

- Reliance on keyword matching for agent selection
- Limited external knowledge sources (Wikipedia only)
- Placeholder implementation for vector database
- No reinforcement learning for response improvement

## 5. Future Work

Potential areas for future improvement include:

- Implementing full vector database functionality
- Adding more external knowledge sources
- Implementing reinforcement learning for response improvement
- Developing a web-based user interface
- Adding user authentication and personalization
- Implementing more sophisticated agent selection logic

## 6. Conclusion

The Adaptive Multi-Agent Chatbot System successfully demonstrates the application of modern AI techniques to create an intelligent conversational system. The multi-agent architecture, context-awareness capabilities, and external knowledge integration enable the system to provide relevant and coherent responses across multiple domains.

The modular design allows for future extensions and improvements, making the system adaptable to evolving requirements and technologies.
