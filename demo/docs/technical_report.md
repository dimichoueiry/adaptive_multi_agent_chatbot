# Technical Report: Adaptive Multi-Agent Chatbot System using Ollama

## Executive Summary

This technical report details the design, implementation, and evaluation of an Adaptive Multi-Agent Chatbot System using Ollama. The system features a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents for different domains (Concordia CS admissions, AI knowledge, and general questions), leveraging modern language models through Ollama for natural language processing and understanding.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Objective

The objective of this project was to create an intelligent multi-agent chatbot system that can effectively handle queries across different specialized domains, particularly focusing on Concordia CS admissions, AI-related topics, and general knowledge questions.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional chatbots often face challenges with:
- Domain specialization and expertise
- Knowledge integration from external sources
- Efficient query routing to appropriate specialized agents
- Maintaining conversation coherence

This project addresses these challenges through a modular multi-agent architecture and knowledge integration.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture organized into the following components:

```
demo/
├── docs/          # Project documentation
├── src/           # Source code
│   ├── agents/    # Specialized agent implementations
│   ├── api/       # FastAPI endpoints
│   ├── config/    # Configuration management
│   ├── data/      # Data storage and management
│   ├── knowledge/ # Knowledge base integration
│   └── utils/     # Utility functions
├── main.py        # Application entry point
└── todo.md        # Development tasks
```

### 2.2 Component Interactions

The system operates through the following workflow:

1. Client sends a query through the FastAPI endpoint
2. Query is analyzed and routed to the appropriate specialized agent:
   - Concordia CS Agent for university admissions queries
   - AI Agent for artificial intelligence topics
   - General Questions Agent for other topics
3. The agent processes the query using Ollama
4. Response is enhanced with external knowledge when relevant
5. Final response is returned through the API

### 2.3 Technology Stack

The implementation utilizes:

- **Ollama**: Core language model integration
- **FastAPI**: RESTful API framework
- **Python 3.10+**: Primary programming language
- **FAISS**: Vector storage for embeddings
- **Wikipedia API**: External knowledge integration
- **Langchain**: LLM framework integration
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server
- **Python-dotenv**: Environment management

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Multi-Agent System

The system implements three specialized agents:
- **Concordia CS Agent**: Handles queries about Concordia's Computer Science program
- **AI Agent**: Processes artificial intelligence related questions
- **General Questions Agent**: Manages general knowledge queries

### 3.2 Knowledge Integration

External knowledge integration is implemented through:
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Retrieves relevant information from Wikipedia
- **Vector Store**: Uses FAISS for document embeddings and retrieval

### 3.3 API Implementation

The API layer is implemented using FastAPI with:
- **REST Endpoints**: For chat interactions
- **Async Support**: For better performance
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation
- **ReDoc Integration**: Alternative API documentation view

## 4. Evaluation

### 4.1 Functionality Assessment

The system successfully implements:
- Multi-agent architecture with three specialized agents
- External knowledge integration through Wikipedia
- FastAPI-based interface with comprehensive documentation
- Modular and maintainable codebase structure

### 4.2 Performance Considerations

The system is designed for efficiency through:
- Async API implementation
- Efficient query routing to specialized agents
- Vector-based knowledge retrieval
- Environment-based configuration

### 4.3 Current Limitations

Areas for improvement include:
- Limited number of specialized agents
- Single external knowledge source (Wikipedia)
- Basic authentication and security features
- Limited caching implementation

## 5. Future Work

Planned enhancements include:
- Implementation of additional specialized agents
- Integration of authentication and rate limiting
- Enhanced knowledge base integration
- Addition of monitoring and logging
- Implementation of caching mechanisms
- Development of comprehensive test suite

## 6. Conclusion

The Adaptive Multi-Agent Chatbot System successfully demonstrates a practical implementation of a domain-specialized chatbot system. The modular architecture, specialized agents, and external knowledge integration provide a solid foundation for future enhancements and extensions.
